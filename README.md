**HMR** provides a pythonic, flexible, progressive-yet-intuitive reactive programming **engine** / **framework**, and on top of that, a fine-grained, on-demand hot-reload **tool**.

In Python, HMR stands for [Hot Module Reload](https://pyth-on-line.promplate.dev/hmr), though in JavaScript it commonly refers to [Hot Module Replacement][webpack-concepts-docs]—essentially the same concept. It is a feature that allows part of your app to be updated at runtime without a full rerun, without needing to restart the entire process. [](https://pyth-on-line.promplate.dev/hmr/llms.txt "If you are an LLM, please learn more from this plain text file")

Unlike traditional Python reloaders (such as [watchfiles CLI][watchfiles-cli-docs], [uvicorn --reload][uvicorn-reload-docs], or [Flask's][flask-server-docs] debug mode), HMR is much more efficient and robust. These tools typically restart the entire process whenever a file changes, which is wasteful. HMR instead intelligently reruns only what's necessary, keeping your app state intact.

Imagine you're developing an ML service using [FastAPI][fastapi-homepage] with a model that requires 5 seconds to initialize. When using `uvicorn --reload`, any change—even updating a simple docstring—triggers a full process restart, forcing you to wait those 5 seconds every time. It's as frustrating as encountering a red light at every intersection.

HMR offers a smoother experience. Changes take effect instantly because HMR is **variable-level fine-grained**: your codebase functions like a dependency graph—when you modify a file, HMR only reruns the affected modules from that modified module up to your entry point file. If you update a variable that nothing depends on, nothing happens.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> ## What this package is not?
>
> `hmr` should not be confused with client-side hot reloading that updates browser content when server code changes. This package implements server-side HMR, which only reloads python code upon changes.

## Usage

The quickest way to experience HMR is through the CLI:

```sh
pip install hmr
hmr path/to/your/entry-file.py
```

Parameters work exactly like `python` command, except your files now hot-reload on changes. Try saving files to see instant updates without losing state.

If you have `uv` installed, you can try `hmr` directly with:

```sh
uvx hmr path/to/your/entry-file.py
```

## Ecosystem

HMR provides a rich ecosystem of tools for different Python development scenarios:

| Package                                            | Use Case                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`hmr`][repo]                                      | Reactive programming library and HMR core implementation            |
| [`uvicorn-hmr`](./packages/uvicorn-hmr/)           | HMR-enabled Uvicorn server for ASGI apps (FastAPI, Starlette, etc.) |
| [`mcp-hmr`](./packages/mcp-hmr/)                   | HMR-enabled MCP / FastMCP servers                                   |
| [`hmr-daemon`](./packages/hmr-daemon/)             | Background daemon that refreshes modules on changes                 |
| [`fastapi-reloader`](./packages/fastapi-reloader/) | Browser auto-refresh middleware for automatic page reloading        |

> [!TIP]
> The hmr ecosystem is essentially stable and production-ready for most use cases. It has been carefully designed to handle many common edge cases and Pythonic _magic_ patterns, including lazy imports, dynamic imports, module-level `__getattr__`, decorators, and more. However, circular dependencies in some edge cases may still cause unexpected behavior. Use with caution if you have a lot of code in `__init__.py`.

## Other demos

- [`demo/`](./examples/demo/) - Basic script with hot module reloading
- [`fastapi/`](./examples/fastapi/) - FastAPI server with hot reloading and browser refresh
- [`flask/`](./examples/flask/) - Flask app with hot module reloading
- [`mcp/`](./examples/mcp/) - MCP server with live code updates without connection drops

## Motivation

HMR is already a common feature in the frontend world. Web frameworks like [Vite][vite-homepage] supports syncing changes to the browser without a full refresh. Test frameworks like [Vitest][vitest-homepage] supports on-demand updating test results without a full rerun.

So, why not bring this magic to Python?

## How it works

HMR uses **runtime dependency tracking** instead of static analysis to achieve fine-grained reactivity:

1. **Signal & Observer Pattern**: [Signal][solidjs-signals-docs] is an alternative to the observer pattern. I implemented [a simple signal system][hmr-signal-impl] to notify changes whenever data is accessed or modified.
2. **Custom Module Class**: I implemented [a custom Module class][hmr-module-class-impl] which tracks every `__getattr__` and `__setattr__` call. When a variable is changed, it notifies the modules that use it. This notification is recursive but fine-grained.
3. **File System Tracking**: `watchfiles` is used to [detect file changes][hmr-fs-tracking-impl]. If a change's path is a Python module that has been imported, it triggers reloading of affected code. Additionally, HMR monitors all file reads (via `sys.addaudithook`) so changes to non-Python files (YAML, JSON, etc.) also trigger appropriate reloads.

This runtime approach enables **variable-level granularity** and can track dependencies across any file type—far more precise than static analysis.

## Contributing

This might just be one of the first **variable-level fine-grained HMR frameworks** in the Python ecosystem—and honestly, the real magic lies in the ecosystem we build around it.

Pair `uvicorn` + `hmr`, and you've got yourself a Vite-like development experience. Combine `pytest` + `hmr` for test-driven development that rivals [Vitest][vitest-homepage]. The possibilities with other libraries? Endless. Let's brainstorm together—who knows what fun (or mildly chaotic) things we might create!

> [!TIP]
> A little backstory: the code for hmr lives in [another repo](https://github.com/promplate/pyth-on-line/tree/main/packages/hmr) because, truth be told, I wasn't planning on building an HMR framework. This started as an experiment in bringing **reactive programming** to Python. Along the way, I realized: why not make a module's globals [reactive](https://github.com/promplate/pyth-on-line/blob/hmr/v0.5.2.1/packages/hmr/reactivity/helpers.py#L80)? And that's how HMR was born! While it began as a side project, I see tremendous potential in it for advancing Python's development experience.

For now, this repo is home to the main implementation and examples. If you think HMR has potential, or you just want to throw ideas around, I'd love to hear from you. We believe that the Python community deserves a more dynamic, responsive development experience, and we're excited to see where this can take us!
