# Basic Script Example

This example demonstrates the core functionality of HMR with a simple Python script.

## How to Run

After installing dependencies, run the following command in this directory:

```sh
hmr entry.py
```

## What to Observe

Once the script is running, try modifying `a.py` or `b.py`. You will see the output instantly to reflect your changes.
This showcases how HMR intelligently re-runs only the necessary modules without a full application restart.
